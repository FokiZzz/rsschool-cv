## Summary:
I was fond of programming from my young age but kept using my programming skills to help me with different tasks during my education and work.

I am motivated and focused on my goal to become Junior Web Developer and grow as a professional in this area.

  }
}
```

## Experience 
Majority of my experience comes from completing tasks and projects for different educational programs.
